## Announcing the general availability of Azure Ultra Disk Storage
https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/announcing-the-general-availability-of-azure-ultra-disk-storage/

Today, we are announcing the general availability (GA) of Microsoft Azure Ultra Disk Storage—a new Managed Disks offering that delivers unprecedented and extremely scalable performance with sub-millisecond latency for the most demanding Azure Virtual Machines and container workloads. With Ultra Disk Storage, customers are now able to lift-and-shift mission critical enterprise applications to the cloud including applications like SAP HANA, top tier SQL databases such as SQL Server, Oracle DB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL, as well as NoSQL databases such as MongoDB and Cassandra. With the introduction of Ultra Disk Storage, Azure now offers four types of persistent disks—Ultra Disk Storage, Premium SSD, Standard SSD, and Standard HDD. This portfolio gives our customers a comprehensive set of disk offerings for every workload.

## Geo Zone Redundant Storage in Azure now in preview
https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/geo-zone-redundant-storage-in-azure-now-in-preview/

Announcing the preview of Geo Zone Redundant Storage in Azure. Geo Zone Redundant Storage provides a great balance of high performance, high availability, and disaster recovery and is beneficial when building highly available applications or services in Azure. Geo Zone Redundant Storage helps achieve higher data resiliency by doing the following:- Synchronously writing three replicas of your data across multiple Azure Availability Zones, such as zone-redundant storage today, protecting from cluster, datacenter, or entire zone failure.- Asynchronously replicating the data to another region within the same geo into a single zone, such as locally redundant storage, protecting from a regional outage.

## Improving Azure Virtual Machines resiliency with Project Tardigrade
https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/improving-azure-virtual-machines-resiliency-with-project-tardigrade/

Codenamed Project Tardigrade, this effort draws its inspiration from the eight-legged microscopic creature, the tardigrade also known as the water bear. Virtually impossible to kill, tardigrades can be exposed to extreme conditions, but somehow still manage to wiggle their way to survival. This is exactly what we envision our servers to emulate when we consider resiliency, hence the name Project Tardigrade. Similar to a tardigrade’s survival across a wide range of extreme conditions, this project involves building resiliency and self-healing mechanisms across multiple layers of the platform ranging from hardware to software, all with a view towards safeguarding your virtual machines (VMs) as much as possible.
