## Announcing the general availability of Proximity Placement Groups

https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/announcing-the-general-availability-of-proximity-placement-groups/

Earlier this year, we announced the preview of Azure proximity placement groups to enable customers to achieve co-location of Azure Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) resources with low network latency.

Today’s general availability of proximity placement groups continues to be particularly useful for workloads that require low latency. In fact, this logical grouping construct ensures that your IaaS resources (virtual machines, or VMs) are physically located close to each other and adds new features and best practices for success.

## Advancing no-impact and low-impact maintenance technologies

We regularly update Azure host infrastructure to improve the reliability, performance, and security of the platform. While the purposes of these ‘maintenance’ updates vary, they typically involve updating software components in the hosting environment or decommissioning hardware. If we go back five years, the only way to apply some of these updates was by fully rebooting the entire host. This approach took customer virtual machines (VMs) down for minutes at a time. Since then, we have invested in a variety of technologies to minimize customer impact when updating the fleet. Today, the vast majority of updates to the host operating system are deployed in place with absolute transparency and zero customer impact using hot patching. In infrequent cases in which the update cannot be hot patched, we typically utilize low-impact memory preserving update technologies to roll out the update.

## Azure Lighthouse: The managed service provider perspective

Azure Lighthouse became generally available in July this year and we have seen a tremendous response from Azure managed service provider communities who are excited about the scale and precision of management that the Azure platform now enables with cross tenant management. Similarly, customers are empowered with architecting precise and just enough access levels to service providers for their Azure environments. Both customers and partners can decide on the precise scope of the projection.

## Better performance with bursting enhancement on Azure Disks

https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/better-performance-with-bursting-enhancement-on-azure-disks/

We introduced the preview of bursting support on Azure Premium SSD Disks, and new disk sizes 4/8/16 GiB on both Premium & Standard SSDs at Microsoft Ignite in November. We would like to share more details about it. With bursting, eligible Premium SSD disks can now achieve up to 30x of the provisioned performance target, better handling for spiky workloads. If you have workloads running on-premises with less predictable disk traffic, you can migrate to Azure and improve your overall performance taking advantage of bursting support.
