One of the latest innovations in SAP on Azure, developed by the Azure Logic Apps team, is a new SAP connector that helps companies easily integrate with the ERP systems that are critical to the day-to-day success of a business.

https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/announcing-the-general-availability-of-python-support-in-azure-functions/

Python support for Azure Functions is now generally available and ready to host your production workloads across data science and machine learning, automated resource management, and more. You can now develop Python 3.6 apps to run on the cross-platform, open-source Functions 2.0 runtime. These can be published as code or Docker containers to a Linux-based serverless hosting platform in Azure. This stack powers the solution innovations of our early adopters, with customers such as General Electric Aviation and TCF Bank already using Azure Functions written in Python for their serverless production workloads. Our thanks to them for their continued partnership!

## Azure Archive Storage expanded capabilities: faster, simpler, better
https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azure-archive-storage-expanded-capabilities-faster-simpler-better/

Since launching Azure Archive Storage, we have seen unprecedented interest and innovative usage from a variety of industries. Archive Storage is built as a scalable service for cost-effectively storing rarely accessed data for long periods of time. Cold data such as application backups, healthcare records, autonomous driving recordings, etc. that might have been previously deleted could be stored in Azure Storage’s Archive tier in an offline state, then rehydrated to an online tier when needed. Earlier this month, we made Azure Archive Storage even more affordable by reducing prices by up to 50 percent in some regions, as part of our commitment to provide the most cost-effective data storage offering.
