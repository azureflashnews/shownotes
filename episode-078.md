## Introducing Azure Spring Cloud: fully managed service for Spring Boot microservices

https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/introducing-azure-spring-cloud-fully-managed-service-for-spring-boot-microservices/

As customers have moved their workloads to the cloud, weâ€™ve seen a growth in the use of cloud-native architectures, particularly microservices. Microservice-based architectures help improve scalability and velocity but implementing them can pose challenges. For many Java developers, Spring Boot and Spring Cloud have helped address these challenges, providing a robust platform with well-established patterns for developing and operating microservice applications. But creating and maintaining a Spring Cloud environment requires work. Such as setting up the infrastructure for dynamic scaling, installing and managing multiple components, and wiring up the application to your logging infrastructure.
