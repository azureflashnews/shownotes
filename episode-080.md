## Improving observability of your Kubernetes deployments with Azure Monitor for containers

https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/improving-observability-of-your-kubernetes-deployments-with-azure-monitor-for-containers/

Over the past few years, weâ€™ve seen significant changes in how an application is thought of and developed, especially with the adoption of containers and the move from traditional monolithic applications to microservices applications. This shift also affects how we think about modern application monitoring, now with greater adoption of open source technologies and the introduction of observability concepts.

In the past, vendors owned the application and infrastructure, and as a result, they knew what metrics to monitor. With open source products growing in number, vendors do not own all the metrics, and custom metrics are extremely necessary with current monitoring tools.

https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/sharing-the-devops-journey-at-microsoft/

Today, more and more organizations are focused on delivering new digital solutions to customers and finding that the need for increased agility, improved processes, and collaboration between development and operation teams is becoming business-critical. For over a decade, DevOps has been the answer to these challenges. Understanding the need for DevOps is one thing, but the actual adoption of DevOps in the real world is a whole other challenge. How can an organization with multiple teams and projects, with deeply rooted existing processes, and with considerable legacy software change its ways and embrace DevOps?
