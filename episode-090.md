## Azure Arc enabled Kubernetes preview and new ecosystem partners

https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azure-arc-enabled-kubernetes-preview-and-new-ecosystem-partners/

In November 2019, we announced the preview of Azure Arc, a set of technologies that unlocks new hybrid scenarios for customers by bringing Azure services and management to any infrastructure across datacenters, edge, and multi-cloud. Based on the feedback and excitement of all the customers in the private preview, we are able to deliver Azure Arc enabled Kubernetes in preview to our customers. With this, anyone can use Azure Arc to connect and configure any Kubernetes cluster across customer datacenters, edge locations, and multi-cloud.

## Azure Lighthouse—managing cloud, hybrid, and edge environments at-scale through a single control plane

https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azure-lighthouse-managing-cloud-hybrid-and-edge-environments-atscale-through-a-single-control-plane/

Thousands of partners and enterprises use Azure Lighthouse to manage services across Azure tenants, representing tens of thousands of subscriptions and more than one million Azure resources from Azure Resource Manager—a unified control plane. With Azure Lighthouse, service providers, as well as self-managing enterprises, can achieve higher operational efficiency using Azure’s comprehensive and robust management tools. You can now view and manage resources, with higher automation, scale, and enhanced governance across hybrid estates and on-premises.

## Streamlining your image building process with Azure Image Builder

Azure Image Builder service offers unification and simplification for your image building process across Azure and Azure Stack with an automated image building pipeline. Whether you want to build Windows or Linux virtual machine images, you can use existing image security configurations to build compliant images for your organization and patch existing custom images using Linux commands or Windows Update. Azure Image Builder supports images from multiple Linux distributions, Azure Marketplace, and Windows Virtual Desktop environments and you can build images for specialized VM sizes, including creating images for GPU VMs.

## Microsoft and Docker collaborate on new ways to deploy containers on Azure

https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/microsoft-and-docker-collaborate-on-new-ways-to-deploy-containers-on-azure/

Now more than ever, developers need agility to meet rapidly increasing demands from customers. Containerization is one key way to increase agility. Containerized applications are built in a more consistent and repeatable way, by way of defining desired infrastructure, dependencies, and configuration as code for all stages of the lifecycle. Applications often start and stop faster at runtime too, which often helps quickly start, stop, scale out, and update in the cloud.

With this in mind, we announced a new partnership earlier today between Microsoft and Docker to integrate Docker Desktop more closely with Microsoft Azure and the Visual Studio line of products.
