## Harnessing the power of the Location of Things with Azure Maps
https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/harnessing-the-power-of-the-location-of-things-with-azure-maps/

Today, we’re unveiling a cross-Azure IoT collaboration simplifying the use of location and spatial intelligence used in conjunction with IoT messaging. The result is the means for customers to use Azure IoT services to stay better informed about their “things” in terms of space. Azure IoT customers can now implement IoT spatial analytics using Azure Maps. Providing spatial intelligence to IoT devices means greater insights into not just what’s happening, but where it’s happening.

Demo time baby!
