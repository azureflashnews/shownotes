# Change - 10-4-2019

We are going to be changing the scheduling of the show.  We're going to try and do the show about every week, but not necessarily at 9:30 on Friday.  We'll try and keep the aka.ms/joinafn pointing to the latest show, but you are always welcome to subscribe to YouTube if you'd like the video or the podcasts on Apple iTunes or Google Play if you'd like to catch the show that way.

See you there!
