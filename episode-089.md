## Monitor your Azure workload compliance with Azure Security Benchmark

https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/monitor-your-azure-workload-compliance-with-azure-security-benchmark/

Previously, Azure Migrate: Server Assessment only supported VMware and Hyper-V virtual machine assessments for migration to Azure. At Ignite 2019, we added physical server support for assessment features like Azure suitability analysis, migration cost planning, performance-based rightsizing, and application dependency analysis. You can now plan at-scale, assessing up to 35K physical servers in one Azure Migrate project. If you use VMware or Hyper-V as well, you can discover and assess both physical and virtual servers in the same project. You can create groups of servers, assess by group and refine the groups further using application dependency information.

The Azure Security Benchmark v1 was released in January 2020 and is being used by organizations to manage their security and compliance policies for their Azure workloads. We are pleased to share that you can now track and monitor your compliance with the benchmark across your Azure environment in Azure Security Center.

## Automating cybersecurity guardrails with new Zero Trust blueprint and Azure integrations

https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/automating-cybersecurity-guardrails-with-new-zero-trust-blueprint-and-azure-integrations/

The Azure blueprint for Zero Trust enables application developers and security administrators to more easily create hardened environments for their application workloads. Essentially, the blueprint will help you implement Zero Trust controls across six foundational elements: identities, devices, applications, data, infrastructure, and networks.

Using the Azure Blueprints service, the Zero Trust blueprint will first configure your VNET to deny all network traffic by default, enabling you to extend it and/or set rules for selective traffic based on your business needs. In addition, the blueprint will enforce and maintain Azure resource behaviors and configuration in compliance with specific NIST SP 800-53 security control requirements using Azure Policy.

## Azure Container Registry: Mitigating data exfiltration with dedicated data endpoints

https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azure-container-registry-mitigating-data-exfiltration-with-dedicated-data-endpoints/

Azure Container Registry announces dedicated data endpoints, enabling tightly scoped client firewall rules to specific registries, minimizing data exfiltration concerns.

Pulling content from a registry involves two endpoints:

*-* Registry endpoint, often referred to as the login URL, used for authentication and content discovery.
A command like docker pull contoso.azurecr.io/hello-world makes a REST request which authenticates and negotiates the layers which represent the requested artifact.
*-* Data endpoints serve blobs representing content layers.
